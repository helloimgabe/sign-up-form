# sign-up-form
The sign up form project from The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS course.

The goal is to create a sign up form using intermediate HTML and CSS concepts. The webpage itself is not ideally responsive because I will learn responsive design later in the curriculum.

Known (intentional) bug: on smaller monitors, the content in the viewport does not scale down appropriately and will overflow. On larger monitors (I work on a 27" 1440p monitor) all content should be visible and interactable.

Here's to future me learning responsive web design and cringing at what old me made! lol
